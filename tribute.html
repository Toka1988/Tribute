          "I have fought against white domination, and I have
          fought against black domination. I have cherished
          the ideal of a democratic and free society in which
          all persons will live together in harmony and with
          equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live
          for and to see realised. But if it needs be, it is an
          ideal for which I am prepared to die."
